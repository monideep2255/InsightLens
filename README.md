# InsightLens - AI-Powered Company Research Assistant

InsightLens is an AI-powered research assistant designed to help users evaluate companies through the lens of value investing principles (Benjamin Graham/Warren Buffett approach). The system processes financial reports from the SEC EDGAR database or uploaded PDF documents and generates structured insight cards with analysis on various aspects of a company, including Business Summary, Moat & Edge, Basic Financial Health, and Management Snapshot. Featuring direct access to 10-K filings for the "Magnificent 7" tech companies and robust caching for efficient API usage.

## Known Limitations

- Large PDFs (>500 pages) use intelligent sampling for better performance
- API rate limits apply for SEC EDGAR and AI services
- Document processing time varies based on file size and AI provider load
- Analysis quality depends on document content quality and depth
- Demo mode provides sample insights without API costs but with less specificity

## Local Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Python 3.11 or higher
   - PostgreSQL database server
   - Python packages listed in pyproject.toml

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r sample_requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_random_secret_key
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/insightlens

   # Choose ONE AI provider:

   # Option 1: Hugging Face (recommended)
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
   AI_MODEL_TYPE=huggingface
   HUGGINGFACE_MODEL=mistral  # Options: mistral, llama3, deepseek

   # Option 2: OpenAI
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   # AI_MODEL_TYPE=openai
   ```

4. **Set up PostgreSQL**
   - Create a database named 'insightlens'
   - Update DATABASE_URL in .env with your credentials
   - Initialize database:
     ```bash
     python recreate_db.py
     ```

5. **Run the application**
   Development mode:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Production mode:
   ```bash
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
   ```
   The application will be available at http://0.0.0.0:5000

### Alternative Deployment Options

1. **Traditional Server Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r sample_requirements.txt

   # Set up environment variables
   export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/insightlens

   # Initialize database
   python recreate_db.py

   # Run with Gunicorn
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers 4 main:app
   ```

2. **Docker Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker compose -f docker-compose.sample.yml build

   # Start the services
   docker compose -f docker-compose.sample.yml up -d
   ```

   The application will be available at http://localhost:5000

3. **Production Considerations**
   - Use a production-grade database
   - Configure proper logging
   - Set up monitoring
   - Implement backup strategies
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)

For most users, we recommend using Replit's deployment options for the best development experience and easiest maintenance.
