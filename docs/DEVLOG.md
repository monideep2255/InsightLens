## Day 1 (Initial Setup) - March 28, 2024

### Accomplished
- Set up basic Flask application structure
- Created initial database models (Document, Processing, Insight)
- Implemented document processing service with PDF and URL support
- Set up routes for document handling and processing
- Configured Gunicorn server for production deployment

### Blockers
- API AI calls not functioning properly
- Search results not returning as expected
- Initial setup successful but core functionality needs debugging

### Next Steps
- Debug AI service integration
- Fix search functionality
- Implement proper error handling for API calls

## Day 2 (Performance Optimization) - March 29, 2024

### Accomplished
- Improved response time from >3 minutes to <30 seconds
- Attempted fixes for AI service integration
- Investigated search results issues

### Blockers
- Search functionality still not returning results in any case
- AI processing optimization needed further tuning
- Need to investigate why processed results are empty



## Day 3 (Bug Fixes & Improvements) - April 1, 2024

### Accomplished
- Fixed search functionality for SEC EDGAR documents
- Implemented better error handling for document processing
- Added progress tracking for document analysis
- Enhanced UI responsiveness during processing
- Added token usage tracking and cost estimation

### Blockers
- Some long documents still timing out during processing
